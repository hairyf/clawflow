# Agent-Flow Skill

Agent skill based on [whrit/agent-flow](https://github.com/whrit/agent-flow): multi-agent orchestration (Swarm, Hive-Mind), multi-provider LLM, MCP tools, SPARC, and architecture knowledge. Use when orchestrating Flow-Agent / Claude-Flow style workflows or integrating Codex.

| System architecture | Layers, core components, design patterns | [advanced-architecture](references/advanced-architecture.md) |
| Topologies & consensus | Topology selection, consensus, distributed memory | [advanced-topologies-consensus](references/advanced-topologies-consensus.md) |
| Codex parity & testing | Parity docs and test commands | [advanced-parity-testing](references/advanced-parity-testing.md) |

## When to use this skill

- Understanding or using Flow-Agent / Claude-Flow Swarm, Hive-Mind, CLI, and MCP
- Integrating or debugging the Codex provider, running parity/smoke tests
- Designing multi-agent topologies, consensus, or memory strategies
- Looking up SPARC, Hooks, automation, and architecture details
